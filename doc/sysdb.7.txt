NAME
----
sysdb - the System DataBase (SysDB)

SYNOPSIS
--------

  sysdbd -C /path/to/sysdbd.conf

  sysdb -H /path/to/sysdbd.sock

DESCRIPTION
-----------
include::sysdb-description.txt[]

SysDB is made up of several components:

sysdbd
~~~~~~
The SysDB daemon acts as the data collection instance and database server. It
collects system and inventory information from the backends and aggregates
objects retrieved from different backends based on their attributes. This way,
it creates a uniform hierarchy of the entire infrastructure.

For details about the SysDB daemon, see its manual page manpage:sysdbd[1].

sysdb
~~~~~
The SysDB client is a terminal-based, interactive shell which may be used to
query the SysDB daemon. It connects to a running daemon and then accepts
commands from the user, sends them to the server, and displays the results.

For details about the SysDB client, see its manual page manpage:sysdb[1]. For
details about how to query the database, see the specification of the SysDB
query language in manpage:sysdbql[7].

CONCEPTS
--------
SysDB's features are build around a set of concepts which are explained in
this section.

Hosts and Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The basic building block of SysDB's store are host and service objects
representing physical and logical resources. Each host is identified by a
unique name and each service is identified by a unique pair of a hostname and
a service name. All services are assigned to the respective host which is
usually interpreted as the service running on that host. In addition, hosts
and services may have a list of attributes assigned to them. These are
arbitrary key-value pairs providing additional information about the
respective object and they may be used to further categorize and identify an
object. For example, the *mk-livestatus* and *puppet::store-configs* backend
plugins provide a list of all hosts and services known to the monitoring
system queried through the Check_MK livestatus interface and all hosts will be
attributed with all "fact" values known to Puppet. This allows to query hosts
based on facts like architecture or LSB information using query commands like
*LOOKUP* (see manpage:sysdbql[7]).

Host and service objects are managed by backend plugins and queried from other
systems, like inventory databases or monitoring systems.

Hostname Canonicalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before storing an object in SysDB's store, any hostname used to identify the
object is canonicalized. This is done by so called "cname" plugins and may be
based on arbitrary information derived from the original hostname. This way,
hosts provided by different backends may be mapped to the same host in SysDB
even if, for example, one backend uses short hostnames while another uses
fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). For example, the *cname::dns* plugin
uses reverse DNS queries to resolve a name to its canonical hostname as
provided by DNS.

Metrics and Time-Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A metric identifies performance data about a host. SysDB does not collect or
store the actual data but collects information about which metrics are
available from backends. It then provides a generic way to fetch time-series
data directly from a backend's data-store. In some cases, this requires
additional configuration. For example, the *collectd::unixsock* plugin
provides information about which metrics are available from a collectd
instance. Using the *TimeseriesBackend* and *TimeseriesBaseURL* configuration
options (see manpage:sysdbd-collectd-unixsock[5]), SysDB may be told where to
fetch time-series data from. The details are automatically managed by the
plugin and the *timeseries::rrdtool* plugin may be used to fetch the data from
RRD files managed by collectd. Fetching the data may be done using the
*TIMESERIES* query command (see manpage:sysdbql[7]).
