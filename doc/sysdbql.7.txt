NAME
----
sysdbql - the SysDB query language (SysQL)

SYNOPSIS
--------

  LIST hosts;
  LIST services;

  FETCH host 'some.host.name';

  LOOKUP hosts MATCHING attribute['architecture'] = 'amd64'
               FILTER age < 5 * interval;

DESCRIPTION
-----------
include::sysdb-description.txt[]

The SysDB query language (SysQL) is a human-readable format for describing a
request to retrieve data from a SysDB daemon. It is very remotely similar to
the Standard Query Language (SQL) supported by relational database management
systems (RDBMS) but specialized for SysDB's use-case.

QUERY COMMANDS
--------------
Each command is terminated by a semicolon. The following commands are
available to retrieve information from SysDB:

*LIST* hosts|services|metrics [*FILTER* '<filter_condition>']::
Retrieve a sorted (by name) list of all objects of the specified type
currently stored in SysDB. The return value is a list of objects including
their names, the timestamp of the last update and an approximation of the
interval with which the host was updated. When listing services or metrics,
the respective objects will be grouped by host. If a filter condition is
specified, only objects matching that filter will be included in the reply.
See the section "FILTER clause" for more details about how to specify the
search and filter conditions.

*FETCH* host '<hostname>' [*FILTER* '<filter_condition>']::
*FETCH* service|metric '<hostname>'.'<name>' [*FILTER* '<filter_condition>']::
Retrieve detailed information about the specified object. The return value
includes the full object including all of its attributes and child objects.
If the named object does not exist, an error is returned. If a filter
condition is specified, only objects matching that filter will be included in
the reply. See the section "FILTER clause" for more details about how to
specify the search and filter conditions.

*LOOKUP* hosts|services|metrics [*MATCHING* '<search_condition>'] [*FILTER* '<filter_condition>']::
Retrieve detailed information about all objects matching the specified search
condition. The return value is a list of detailed information for each
matching object providing the same details as returned by the *FETCH* command.
If no object matches the search criteria, it's not considered an error.
Instead, an empty list is returned. If a filter condition is specified, only
objects matching that filter will be included in the reply. See the sections
"MATCHING clause" and "FILTER clause" for more details about how to specify
the search and filter conditions.

*TIMESERIES* '<hostname>'.'<metric>' [START '<datetime>'] [END '<datetime>']::
Retrieve a time-series for the specified host's metric. The data is retrieved
from a backend data-store based on information provided by the respective
query plugin. The return value includes the actual start and end time of the
time-series and one or multiple sequences of time-stamp / value pairs. If the
metric does not exist or if the backend data-store is not supported, an error
is returned.

MATCHING clause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *MATCHING* clause in a query specifies a boolean expression which is used
to match objects based on their fields, attributes, or child objects. Any
object for which the expression evaluates to true will be included in the
result set according to the rules set by the actual query.

FILTER clause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *FILTER* clause in a query specifies a boolean expression which is used to
filter objects included in the query's response. The filter is applied to
hosts, services, and attributes alike and, thus, will usually be based on the
core properties of the stored objects. The basic syntax for filter clauses is
the same as for matching clauses.

Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~
Expressions form the basic building block for all queries. Boolean expressions
select objects based on the values of arithmetic expressions which operate on
object specific values (fields) or constant values.

Boolean expressions may use the following operators:

'<expression>' *AND* '<expression>'::
'<expression>' *OR* '<expression>'::
	Evaluates to the logical AND or logical OR of the specified
	subexpressions.

*NOT* '<expression>'::
	Invert the boolean result of the specified subexpression.

'<expression>' '<cmp>' '<expression>'::
	Compare the values of two expressions using any compare operator (see
	below). Evaluates to either true or false. Comparing any value with a NULL
	value always evaluates to false. The data types of the two values have to
	match except for a few cases as noted in the documentation of the
	respective operator.

*ANY* '<iterable>' '<cmp>' '<expression>'::
	Compares each element of an iterable using any compare operator. Evaluates
	to true if any of the elements matches or false if no such elements exist.
	Otherwise, the same rules as for other comparison operations apply.
	Attributes, a host's services and metrics, and arrays are iterables.

*ALL* '<iterable>' '<cmp>' '<expression>'::
	*ALL* is similar to the *ANY* operator but matches if all elements match
	or if no elements exist.

'<expression>' *IS NULL*::
'<expression>' *IS NOT NULL*::
	Check whether an expression evaluates to a NULL value (or not). An
	expression evaluates to NULL if the queried object does not exist (e.g.,
	when accessing an attribute value).

'<expression>' *IN* '<expression>'::
	Checks whether the value of the first expression is included in the value
	of the second expression which has to be an array value (e.g., *backend*
	field). If the second value is not an array or if the type of the first
	value does not match the array's element type, the expression always
	evaluates to false.

Parentheses ('()') may be used around subexpressions to group them and enforce
precedence.

The following fields may be queried:

*name*::
	The canonicalized name of the object. The type of this field is string.

*last_update*::
	The timestamp of the last update of the object. This value is based on
	information provided by the queried backend if possible. The type of this
	field is date-time.

*age*::
	The amount of time since the last update of the object. The type of this
	field is date-time.

*interval*::
	The interval with which the object gets updated. This value is determined
	automatically based on a moving average determined from the update
	timestamps of an object. It depends on the update timestamps as provided
	by the backend (if available) and SysDB's query interval. The type of this
	field is date-time.

*backend*::
	The name of the backend (plugin) providing the data. The type of this
	field is array of strings.

*attribute[*'<name>'*]*::
	The value of the object's named attribute. If an attribute of the
	specified name does not exist, each comparison is treated as if the value
	does not match. See the documentation for the *IS NULL* and *IS NOT NULL*
	operators for ways to check if an attribute exists. The value of an
	attribute may be of any of the supported data types. There is no schema
	specifying each attribute's data type which means that the parser cannot
	do any type checks. Thus, in case the data types mismatch when comparing
	an attribute value with some other value, the two values will be cast to
	strings before comparing them.

The following logical operators are supported by SysDB. Unless otherwise
noted, the data types of the left hand and right hand side have to match.

*=*::
	Checks two values for equality.

*!=*::
	Checks two values for inequality.

*=~*::
	Checks if a value matches a regular expression. The regex pattern has to
	be specified as a string but the value may be of any type and will be cast
	to a string before evaluating the regular expression. SysDB uses POSIX
	extended regular expressions.

*!~*::
	Checks if a value does not match a regular expression. The same rules
	apply as for the *=~* operator.

*<*, *\<=*, *>=*, *>*::
	Checks whether a value compares less than, less than or equal to, greater
	than or equal, or greater than some other value.

The following arithmetic operators are supported by SysDB. Unless otherwise 
noted, the data types of the left hand and right hand side have to match.

*+*::
*-*::
	Add or subtract two numeric or date-time values.

***::
*/*::
	Multiple or divide two numeric or data-time values. A date-time value may
	be multiplied with a numeric value or divided by a numeric value. The
	result will then be a date-time value.

*%*::
	Modulo operator (remainder of division). Same rules for data types apply
	as for division.

*||*::
	Concatenate string or array values.

DATA TYPES
----------
The SysDB query language natively supports various data-types. Constants of
all types may be used in any place where a value is expected.

*String constants*::
	A string constant is an arbitrary sequence of characters enclosed in
	single quotes ('''). Single quotes may be included in a string constant by
	specifying two adjacent single quotes.

*Integer constants*::
	An integer constant may be specified either as a sequence of digits or in
	scientific notation written in the form "'a' E 'b'" (without spaces) where
	'a' and 'b' are integers. A leading plus or minus sign specifies the sign
	of the constant.

*Floating-point constants*::
	A floating-point constant is a sequence of digits containing a decimal
	point. Digits before or after the decimal point (but not both) are
	optional. Floating-point constants may also be specified in scientific
	notation by appending the letter "E" and a positive or negative integer
	exponent. A leading plus or minus sign specifies the sign of the constant.

*Date and time constants*::
	A date constant may be specified as 'YYYY-MM-DD' and time constants may be
	specified as 'HH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnn' where seconds and nanoseconds are
	optional.

*Interval constants*::
	An interval may be specified by one or multiple quantity and unit pairs.
	The quantity may be any integer constant and the unit may be any of the
	following: *Y* (years), *M* (months), *D* (days), *h* (hours), *m*
	(minutes), *s* (seconds), *ms* (milliseconds), *us* (microseconds), or
	*ns* (nanoseconds). Note that years and months are approximations.
